# social-game-task-tracker

Hi, I want to create a social game where every participant get's a name of another praticipant and a word the other guy need to say. If the other guy saying this word, then he wins a point, and gets his task (make someonelse to say a word). I want you to develop the webapp, where the input will be a list of particiapnts, phone number and a word they should say. and the output will be a table where for each person will be his phone number, and a message to sent him, with the message: 
"Hi {name}, you are invited to play with us! You need to make {pair} say the word {word}. Best luck!" 

Few importnatn things:
1. every word should be diffrent. the user can choose a word from. ransom words list or write it himself. in addition, he can edit it manually. 
2. a person can't get himself obviusly.
